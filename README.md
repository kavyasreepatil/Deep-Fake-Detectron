# DeepFake Detectron

DeepFake Detectron is a deep learning-based system designed to detect deepfake videos and images using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks. This project leverages **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **InceptionV3** models to achieve high accuracy in identifying manipulated media.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Approach**: Utilizes VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 for robust detection.
- **Pretrained Weights**: Uses pretrained models on ImageNet and fine-tunes them for deepfake detection.
- **High Accuracy**: Combines the strengths of multiple architectures to enhance detection performance.
- **Scalability**: Can be deployed in real-time applications for video analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow & PyTorch
- **Models**: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3
- **Dataset**: DeepFake detection datasets
- **Backend**: Flask for API deployment
